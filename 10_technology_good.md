*Digital rights and opportunities in the modern age*

![Technology for Good](images/10_technology.png)

Technology is not neutral. Every algorithm, every platform design choice, every data collection practice embodies values and shapes human behaviour. The question is not whether technology will transform society – it already has – but whether that transformation will serve human flourishing or undermine it. The liberal answer is clear: we must harness technology for good, ensuring that digital innovation enhances rather than erodes our fundamental rights and freedoms.

The digital revolution has brought unprecedented opportunities: instant global communication, access to the world's knowledge, new forms of creativity and collaboration, and tools that can solve humanity's greatest challenges. Yet it has also created new forms of exploitation, surveillance, and control that would make Orwell's Big Brother seem quaint by comparison. The challenge for liberals is to embrace technology's potential while safeguarding the values that make us human.

**The Liberal Vision for Digital Rights**

A liberal approach to technology policy must be grounded in fundamental principles:

- **Human Agency**: Technology should enhance human choice and capability, not replace human judgment or manipulate behaviour
- **Privacy as a Fundamental Right**: Personal data is not a commodity to be harvested and sold, but an extension of personal autonomy
- **Transparency and Accountability**: Algorithmic systems that affect people's lives must be explainable and subject to democratic oversight
- **Digital Equality**: Everyone should have access to the benefits of digital technology, regardless of income, location, or technical expertise
- **Innovation with Responsibility**: Technological progress must be balanced with protection of human rights and social cohesion

**Balancing Privacy with Protecting Children Online**

One of the most challenging issues in digital policy is how to protect children from online harm while preserving privacy rights and avoiding censorship. This requires careful distinction between legitimate platform responsibility and dangerous government overreach.

**Platform Responsibility vs. Censorship**

The liberal approach recognises a crucial distinction between two very different policy approaches:

**Platform Responsibility** (Liberal Approach):
- Requiring platforms to have robust systems to detect and remove genuinely harmful content, particularly content that exploits children
- Mandating transparency about content moderation policies and their enforcement
- Ensuring platforms respond quickly to reports of illegal content
- Requiring age-appropriate design that protects children by default
- Post-publication removal of content that violates clear, narrowly defined standards

**Government Censorship** (Illiberal Approach):
- Pre-publication review of content by government authorities
- Broad, vague definitions of "harmful" content that could capture legitimate speech
- Government agencies deciding what legal content adults can access
- Blocking or filtering systems that prevent access to lawful information
- Using child protection as a pretext for broader surveillance and control

The key liberal principle is that **platforms, not governments, should be responsible for content moderation**, but within a framework of democratic accountability and clear legal standards.

**Age-Appropriate Design and Privacy by Default**

Children deserve special protection online, but this protection must be built into the design of digital services, not imposed through surveillance:

- **Privacy by Default**: Services used by children should collect minimal data and provide maximum privacy protection as the default setting
- **Age-Appropriate Design**: Platforms should be designed with children's developmental needs in mind, avoiding manipulative design patterns
- **Parental Tools**: Parents should have effective tools to help protect their children online, without compromising the privacy of other users
- **Education and Digital Literacy**: Children should be taught how to navigate the digital world safely and critically

<div align="right"><sub>94</sub></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

---

**Protecting Children Without Mass Surveillance**

The temptation to use child protection as justification for mass surveillance must be resisted. Effective child protection can be achieved through:

- **Targeted Enforcement**: Focusing resources on detecting and prosecuting those who create and distribute illegal content
- **Industry Standards**: Requiring platforms to implement effective safeguards without mandating specific technologies
- **International Cooperation**: Working with other countries to tackle cross-border online crimes
- **Support for Victims**: Providing comprehensive support for children who have been harmed online

**The Right to Privacy in the Digital Age**

Privacy is not about having something to hide – it's about having the space to be human. In the digital age, privacy enables:

- **Intellectual Freedom**: The ability to explore ideas, read, and learn without surveillance
- **Personal Development**: The space to make mistakes, change opinions, and grow as a person
- **Democratic Participation**: The ability to engage in political activity without fear of retaliation
- **Human Relationships**: The capacity for intimate, authentic connections with others

A liberal government would enshrine strong privacy rights in law:

- **Data Protection**: Comprehensive data protection laws that give individuals control over their personal information
- **Surveillance Limits**: Clear legal limits on government surveillance, with robust judicial oversight
- **Corporate Accountability**: Strong penalties for companies that misuse personal data
- **Right to Explanation**: The right to understand how algorithmic systems make decisions that affect you

**Digital Democracy and Algorithmic Accountability**

Social media platforms and search engines have become the new public square, yet they operate according to opaque algorithms designed to maximise engagement rather than promote democratic discourse. A liberal approach would:

<div align="right"><sub>95</sub></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

---

- **Algorithmic Transparency**: Require platforms to explain how their algorithms work and what factors influence what content users see
- **Democratic Oversight**: Establish independent regulators with the expertise and authority to oversee digital platforms
- **User Control**: Give users meaningful choice over how algorithms curate their online experience
- **Diverse Voices**: Ensure that algorithmic systems don't systematically exclude or marginalise certain viewpoints

**Artificial Intelligence and Human Agency**

As AI systems become more sophisticated, we must ensure they remain tools that enhance human capability rather than replace human judgment:

- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Critical decisions affecting people's lives should always involve meaningful human oversight
- **Explainable AI**: AI systems used in public services, healthcare, or criminal justice must be able to explain their decisions
- **Bias Prevention**: AI systems must be regularly audited for bias and discrimination
- **Worker Protection**: As AI transforms the economy, we must ensure workers are retrained and supported, not simply displaced

**Digital Rights as Human Rights**

The digital world is not separate from the physical world – it's an extension of it. Digital rights are human rights, and they must be protected with the same vigour:

- **Freedom of Expression Online**: The right to speak freely online, subject only to the same legal limits that apply offline
- **Digital Assembly**: The right to organise and associate online, including through encrypted communications
- **Access to Information**: The right to seek, receive, and share information online
- **Digital Due Process**: The right to fair treatment in online spaces, including transparent appeals processes

**The Future of Work in the Digital Age**

<div align="right"><sub>96</sub></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

---

Technology is transforming work at an unprecedented pace. A liberal response must ensure that technological progress benefits everyone:

- **Lifelong Learning**: Investing in education and training systems that help workers adapt to technological change
- **Portable Benefits**: Creating benefit systems that aren't tied to specific employers, giving workers security in a changing economy
- **New Forms of Work**: Recognising and protecting the rights of gig workers and other new forms of employment
- **Reduced Working Hours**: As productivity increases, ensuring that the benefits are shared through shorter working hours and better work-life balance

**Global Digital Governance**

The internet is global, but governance remains national. A liberal approach to digital policy must work across borders:

- **International Cooperation**: Working with like-minded countries to establish common standards for digital rights
- **Resistance to Authoritarianism**: Opposing attempts by authoritarian regimes to fragment the internet or export their surveillance models
- **Development Support**: Helping developing countries build digital infrastructure and governance capacity
- **Tax Justice**: Ensuring that global tech companies pay their fair share of taxes in the countries where they operate

**Innovation and Regulation: Finding the Balance**

The liberal approach to technology regulation is not anti-innovation – it's pro-human innovation. Good regulation can actually spur innovation by creating clear rules of the game and ensuring that competition is based on merit rather than exploitation:

- **Regulatory Sandboxes**: Allowing innovative companies to test new technologies in controlled environments
- **Proportionate Regulation**: Ensuring that regulatory requirements are proportionate to the risks involved
- **Innovation Incentives**: Using public procurement and research funding to encourage innovation that serves the public good
- **Competition Policy**: Preventing tech monopolies from stifling innovation and consumer choice

**Artificial Intelligence: Promise and Peril**

Artificial Intelligence represents perhaps the most significant technological development since the printing press, with the potential to transform every aspect of human life. The liberal approach to AI governance must balance innovation with protection of human rights and democratic values.

The promise of AI is extraordinary. Machine learning can help doctors diagnose diseases earlier and more accurately. AI tutoring systems can personalise education for every student. Predictive algorithms can help prevent crime and allocate resources more efficiently. Climate models powered by AI can help us understand and respond to environmental challenges. The potential for human benefit is immense.

Yet the perils are equally significant. AI systems can perpetuate and amplify human biases, leading to discrimination in hiring, lending, and criminal justice. Autonomous weapons could make killing easier and more impersonal. Surveillance systems powered by AI could enable unprecedented government control over citizens. Deepfakes and AI-generated content could undermine truth itself.

**AI Governance Principles**

A liberal approach to AI governance must be grounded in fundamental principles:

**Human Agency and Oversight**: AI systems should augment rather than replace human decision-making in critical areas. Humans must remain in control of important decisions affecting people's lives, liberty, and wellbeing.

**Algorithmic Transparency**: People have a right to understand how AI systems that affect them work. This doesn't mean revealing trade secrets, but ensuring that the logic and criteria used by AI systems are explainable and auditable.

**Bias Prevention and Fairness**: AI systems must be designed and tested to prevent discrimination based on race, gender, age, disability, or other protected characteristics. This requires diverse development teams and rigorous testing.

<div align="right"><sub>98</sub></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

---

**Democratic Control**: AI development should be subject to democratic oversight, not left entirely to private companies or technical experts. Citizens must have a voice in how AI is developed and deployed.

**Global Cooperation**: AI governance requires international coordination to prevent a "race to the bottom" where countries compete by lowering standards.

**Specific AI Policy Areas**

**Employment and Automation**: Rather than trying to stop technological progress, liberal policy should focus on ensuring its benefits are shared. This includes massive investment in retraining programmes, universal basic services, and policies that encourage human-AI collaboration rather than replacement. We need a "just transition" for the AI age, similar to what we need for the green transition.

**Criminal Justice**: AI should not be used to make final decisions about people's liberty, but can assist human decision-makers with better information and analysis, provided systems are transparent and auditable. Predictive policing algorithms must be carefully monitored to prevent reinforcing existing biases in the criminal justice system.

**Healthcare**: AI can revolutionise medical diagnosis and treatment, but must be subject to rigorous testing and human oversight to ensure patient safety and prevent discrimination. Patients must have the right to human review of AI-assisted medical decisions.

**Education**: AI tutoring systems can personalise learning and help teachers identify students who need additional support, but must not replace human teachers or reduce education to algorithmic optimisation. The goal should be enhancing human potential, not replacing human judgment.

**Financial Services**: AI can improve access to credit and financial services, but algorithmic lending must be transparent and fair. People must have the right to challenge AI-driven financial decisions and understand the criteria used.

**The Platform Economy and Market Power**

<div align="right"><sub>99</sub></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

---

The concentration of digital power in the hands of a few tech giants represents one of the greatest threats to liberal democracy. These platforms control not just markets but information flows, political discourse, and social interaction.

**The Problem of Tech Monopolies**

The current situation is unprecedented in human history. A handful of companies control essential digital infrastructure that billions of people depend on daily. Google processes over 8 billion searches per day. Facebook connects nearly 3 billion people. Amazon hosts a significant portion of the internet's infrastructure. These companies have more power over information and communication than any government in history.

This concentration of power creates multiple problems:

**Market Dominance**: Tech giants use their platform power to favour their own products and services, stifling competition and innovation.

**Data Monopolies**: Network effects and data advantages create insurmountable barriers to competition. The more users a platform has, the more valuable it becomes, creating a winner-takes-all dynamic.

**Political Influence**: Tech companies have enormous lobbying power and can shape public discourse through their algorithms and content policies.

**Innovation Stagnation**: Monopolies reduce incentives for innovation and competition. They can acquire potential competitors before they become threats.

**Democratic Threats**: Platforms can influence elections and political processes through their control over information flows and advertising.

**Liberal Solutions to Tech Monopoly Power**

**Antitrust Enforcement**: Breaking up tech monopolies and preventing anti-competitive mergers. This might include separating platforms from content (preventing Amazon from selling its own products on its marketplace), requiring interoperability (allowing different social media platforms to communicate), and preventing self-preferencing.

**Data Portability and Interoperability**: Allowing users to move their data between platforms and requiring platforms to work together, reducing lock-in effects and enabling competition. If you can take your social network with you when you switch platforms, monopoly power is reduced.

<div align="right"><sub>100</sub></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

---

**Platform Regulation**: Treating large platforms as public utilities with corresponding responsibilities for fair access and non-discrimination. This could include requirements for transparent content moderation, non-discriminatory access, and public interest obligations.

**Public Alternatives**: Supporting public and cooperative alternatives to private platforms, including public social media, search engines, and digital infrastructure. Just as we have public broadcasting, we could have public digital platforms.

**Digital Taxation**: Ensuring tech companies pay fair taxes on their profits, including digital services taxes and minimum corporate tax rates. Tech companies currently pay far lower tax rates than traditional businesses.

**Cybersecurity and Digital Resilience**

In an interconnected world, cybersecurity is national security. Liberal democracies must build resilience against cyber threats while preserving openness and freedom.

**The Cybersecurity Challenge**

Cyber threats are growing in sophistication and scale. State-sponsored hackers from authoritarian regimes regularly attack democratic governments, businesses, and civil society organisations. Criminal networks use ransomware to extort money from hospitals, schools, and local governments. Disinformation campaigns seek to undermine democratic processes and social cohesion.

The challenge for liberal democracies is building cybersecurity without becoming surveillance states. Authoritarian regimes use cybersecurity as a pretext for controlling their citizens. Liberal democracies must find ways to protect themselves while preserving privacy, freedom, and openness.

**Liberal Cybersecurity Strategy**

**International Cooperation**: Working with democratic allies to establish norms for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace and coordinate responses to cyber threats. This includes sharing threat intelligence, coordinating sanctions against cyber criminals, and developing common standards for cybersecurity.

**Public-Private Partnership**: Collaborating with private sector to share threat intelligence and coordinate responses, while maintaining democratic oversight. Most critical infrastructure is privately owned, so government and business must work together.

<div align="right"><sub>101</sub></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

---

**Resilience over Retaliation**: Focusing on building robust defenses and rapid recovery capabilities rather than offensive cyber capabilities. The goal should be protecting citizens and infrastructure, not engaging in cyber warfare.

**Human Rights Protection**: Ensuring cybersecurity measures don't become pretexts for surveillance or restrictions on civil liberties. Cybersecurity laws must be carefully crafted to protect both security and freedom.

**Supply Chain Security**: Diversifying technology supply chains and reducing dependence on authoritarian regimes for critical technology. This includes supporting domestic technology industries and working with democratic allies.

**The Future of Work in the Digital Age**

Technology is transforming work faster than ever before, creating both opportunities and challenges for workers and society.

**The Changing Nature of Work**

The digital revolution is changing not just what jobs exist, but how work is organised. The traditional model of full-time employment with a single employer is giving way to more flexible but often more precarious forms of work. Platform work, remote work, and the gig economy are growing rapidly.

This creates opportunities for flexibility and entrepreneurship, but also challenges for worker protection and social solidarity. Many platform workers lack traditional employment protections like healthcare, pensions, and the right to organise. The line between employee and contractor is increasingly blurred.

**Liberal Responses to Changing Work**

**Lifelong Learning**: Massive investment in education and retraining to help workers adapt to technological change. This includes not just technical skills, but critical thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence – skills that complement rather than compete with AI.

**Portable Benefits**: Ensuring gig workers have access to healthcare, pensions, and other benefits regardless of employment status. This could include universal basic services or portable benefit accounts that workers can take with them between jobs.

<div align="right"><sub>102</sub></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

---

**Worker Rights in the Digital Age**: Extending traditional labour protections to platform workers and ensuring the right to organise. This includes clarifying when platform workers should be classified as employees and ensuring they have collective bargaining rights.

**Universal Basic Services**: Providing universal access to healthcare, education, and other essential services to provide security in a changing economy. This creates a foundation of security that allows people to take risks and adapt to change.

**Technology for Inclusion**: Using technology to create opportunities for disabled people, older workers, and other groups often excluded from the labour market. AI and automation can eliminate barriers and create new forms of accessible work.

**Digital Democracy and Civic Engagement**

Technology can enhance democratic participation, but only if designed with democratic values in mind.

**The Promise of Digital Democracy**

Digital technology offers unprecedented opportunities for democratic participation. Online platforms can enable broader consultation on policy issues. Digital tools can make voting more accessible and convenient. Social media can facilitate political organising and activism. Government data can be made more transparent and accessible.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, digital tools enabled democratic processes to continue when physical meetings were impossible. Online consultations, virtual town halls, and digital voting systems kept democracy functioning.

**The Risks to Democracy**

Yet digital technology also poses serious risks to democratic governance. Social media algorithms can create echo chambers and political polarisation. Disinformation can spread faster than truth. Foreign governments can interfere in elections through social media manipulation. Surveillance technology can be used to monitor and suppress political dissent.

<div align="right"><sub>103</sub></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

---

The same tools that can enhance democracy can also undermine it. The key is ensuring that digital democracy tools are designed with democratic values in mind.

**Liberal Digital Democracy Principles**

**Transparency**: Government use of technology must be open and accountable to citizens. Citizens have a right to know how their government uses digital tools and data.

**Inclusion**: Digital democracy tools must be accessible to all citizens, regardless of technical skills, income, or disability. Digital divides must not become democratic divides.

**Privacy**: Political participation must be protected from surveillance and manipulation. Citizens must be able to participate in democracy without fear of government or corporate monitoring.

**Authenticity**: Measures to combat disinformation while protecting free speech. This requires careful balance between fighting false information and preserving open debate.

**Human Agency**: Technology should enhance rather than replace human political judgment. Citizens must remain in control of their political choices.

**Global Technology Governance**

Technology challenges transcend national borders and require international cooperation to address effectively.

**The Need for Global Governance**

Many technology challenges cannot be solved by individual countries acting alone. Tech companies operate globally and can move operations to avoid regulation. Cyber threats cross borders instantly. Climate change requires global cooperation, including on the environmental impact of digital technology.

Yet global technology governance is complicated by different values and interests. Authoritarian regimes want to use technology for control and surveillance. Some countries prioritise economic development over human rights. Democratic countries must work together to promote liberal values in global technology governance.

**Liberal International Strategy**

**Democratic Technology Alliance**: Coordinating with other democracies on technology regulation and standards. This could include common approaches to AI governance, platform regulation, and cybersecurity.

<div align="right"><sub>104</sub></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

---

**Digital Rights Diplomacy**: Promoting digital rights and freedoms in international forums. This includes supporting civil society organisations, promoting internet freedom, and opposing authoritarian uses of technology.

**Technology Transfer**: Helping developing countries access beneficial technologies while avoiding harmful ones. This includes supporting digital infrastructure development and capacity building.

**Global Tax Coordination**: Working through international organisations to ensure fair taxation of digital companies. This requires coordinated action to prevent tax avoidance and ensure tech companies contribute to public finances.

**Climate Action**: Addressing the environmental impact of digital technology through international cooperation. Data centres and digital devices consume enormous amounts of energy and resources.

**Innovation and Entrepreneurship**

While regulating technology's harms, liberal policy must also support beneficial innovation and entrepreneurship.

**Supporting Innovation**

**Research Investment**: Massive public funding for basic research and development, particularly in areas where private investment is insufficient. This includes fundamental research in AI, quantum computing, biotechnology, and clean energy.

**Startup Support**: Programmes to help new companies compete with tech giants, including access to capital, mentorship, and regulatory support. Small innovative companies should be able to challenge established monopolies.

**Regulatory Sandboxes**: Allowing experimentation with new technologies under relaxed regulations, enabling innovation while managing risks. This allows beneficial innovations to develop while preventing harm.

**Immigration**: Attracting global talent to drive innovation, including skilled workers, entrepreneurs, and researchers. Innovation thrives on diversity and international collaboration.

**Education**: Ensuring education systems prepare people for technological careers, including both technical skills and critical thinking about technology's social impact.

**Responsible Innovation**

**Ethics by Design**: Building ethical considerations into technology development from the start, not as an afterthought. This includes considering social impact, human rights, and environmental effects.

**Impact Assessment**: Requiring assessment of social and environmental impacts of new technologies, similar to environmental impact assessments for major projects.

<div align="right"><sub>105</sub></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

---

**Stakeholder Engagement**: Involving affected communities in technology development decisions, ensuring that those who will be impacted have a voice in how technology is developed.

**Precautionary Principle**: Taking care with technologies that could have irreversible harmful effects, including AI, genetic engineering, and geoengineering.

**Democratic Oversight**: Ensuring public input into decisions about emerging technologies, not leaving these decisions entirely to companies or technical experts.

**The Social Impact of Technology**

Technology's impact extends far beyond economics and politics to fundamental questions about human relationships and social cohesion.

**Technology and Mental Health**

Digital technology has profound effects on mental health and wellbeing. Social media can connect people and provide support, but can also create anxiety, depression, and addiction. The constant connectivity enabled by smartphones can be both liberating and overwhelming.

Research shows concerning trends, particularly among young people. Rates of anxiety and depression have increased alongside smartphone adoption. Sleep patterns are disrupted by screen time. Social comparison on social media can damage self-esteem.

Yet technology can also support mental health. Therapy apps can provide accessible mental health support. Online communities can connect people with similar experiences. Digital tools can help people track and manage their mental health.

**Liberal Digital Wellbeing Policy**

**Design for Wellbeing**: Regulations requiring technology companies to consider mental health impacts of their products. This could include limits on addictive design features and requirements for wellbeing tools.

**Digital Literacy**: Education programmes helping people understand and critically evaluate digital information, manage screen time, and maintain healthy relationships with technology.

**Research and Monitoring**: Investment in research on technology's mental health impacts and monitoring of trends, particularly among young people.

<div align="right"><sub>106</sub></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

---

**Support Services**: Ensuring mental health services are equipped to address technology-related issues and that digital mental health tools meet appropriate standards.

**Technology and Social Cohesion**

Digital technology is changing how we relate to each other and participate in society. Online communities can bring together people with shared interests across geographical boundaries. Social media can facilitate political organising and social movements.

Yet technology can also fragment society. Echo chambers can increase political polarisation. Online harassment can silence voices and exclude people from public discourse. The decline of local news and shared media experiences can reduce social cohesion.

**Building Digital Community**

**Community Building**: Using technology to strengthen rather than replace real-world communities. This includes supporting local digital platforms and using technology to facilitate offline community activities.

**Combating Online Harassment**: Strong measures to prevent online abuse and harassment, particularly targeting women, minorities, and other vulnerable groups.

**Supporting Local Media**: Policies to support local journalism and media, which play crucial roles in community cohesion and democratic accountability.

**Intergenerational Dialogue**: Programmes bringing together different generations to share knowledge and perspectives on technology, bridging digital divides.

**Conclusion: Technology as a Tool for Human Flourishing**

The liberal vision for technology is neither utopian nor dystopian, but pragmatic and humanistic. Technology is a tool – powerful, transformative, but ultimately neutral. What matters is how we choose to use it and who gets to make those choices.

The current trajectory, where a handful of tech billionaires and authoritarian governments shape technology's development with minimal democratic input, is neither inevitable nor acceptable. Liberal democracies can and must assert democratic control over technology, ensuring it serves human flourishing rather than narrow interests.

<div align="right"><sub>107</sub></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

---

This requires new institutions, new regulations, and new forms of international cooperation. It requires investment in education, research, and innovation. Most importantly, it requires a renewed commitment to liberal values in the digital age.

The stakes could not be higher. Technology will shape the future of human civilisation. The question is whether that future will be liberal or authoritarian, democratic or technocratic, human-centred or machine-optimised.

Technology for good is not just about regulating the bad – it's about actively promoting the good. It's about ensuring that the digital revolution serves human flourishing, enhances democratic participation, and creates opportunities for everyone to thrive. In a liberal digital society, technology would be a tool of liberation, not oppression; of connection, not division; of empowerment, not exploitation.

But achieving this vision requires more than good intentions. It requires political will, policy innovation, and the courage to challenge powerful interests. It requires recognising that technology policy is not a technical issue but a fundamentally political one about power, values, and the kind of society we want to live in.

The choice is ours. We can continue to let technology develop according to the narrow interests of tech companies and authoritarian governments, or we can assert democratic control and ensure technology serves the common good. The liberal path is clear – the question is whether we have the wisdom and courage to take it.

The digital future is being written now, in the code of algorithms and the text of legislation. We can choose to write a future that reflects liberal values of freedom, equality, and human dignity – or we can allow others to write it for us. The stakes could not be higher, and the time for action is now.
