## About This Book

When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. British politics has certainly given us plenty of lemons lately: Brexit chaos, economic uncertainty, democratic dysfunction, and a political system that seems increasingly stale. This book is a fresh, zesty approach to liberalism for the second quarter of the 21st century.

Following in the tradition of "The Orange Book: Reclaiming Liberalism" (2004), The Lemon Book seeks to refresh and broaden the liberal agenda for our very different times.

## Page Numbering System

All chapters include right-aligned page markers in HTML format:
```html
<div align="right"><sub>X</sub></div>
```

The page numbers are strategically placed at natural content breaks (section headers, subsections, paragraph breaks) to maintain readability while providing accurate page references for the table of contents and index.

## Scripts & Tools

The `pages/` directory contains Python scripts for:
- Adding page markers at natural content breaks
- Converting between different page marker formats
- Updating table of contents and index page numbers
- Analyzing word counts and page distributions
