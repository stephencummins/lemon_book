## About This Book

When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. British politics has certainly given us plenty of lemons lately: Brexit chaos, economic uncertainty, democratic dysfunction, and a political system that seems increasingly stale. This book is a fresh, zesty approach to liberalism for the second quarter of the 21st century.

Following in the tradition of "The Orange Book: Reclaiming Liberalism" (2004), The Lemon Book seeks to refresh and broaden the liberal agenda for our very different times.
