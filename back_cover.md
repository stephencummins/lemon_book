**When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.**

British politics has handed us plenty of lemons: Brexit chaos, democratic dysfunction, housing crises, and a political establishment incapable of meeting 21st-century challenges. The familiar Labour-versus-Conservative binary feels increasingly stale.

*The Lemon Book* offers a refreshing alternativeâ€”a zesty reimagining of liberalism for our times. Building on the tradition of *The Orange Book*, this bold manifesto squeezes the best from liberal thought whilst discarding what has gone sour. From housing and mental health to capitalism's conscience and digital rights, Stephen Cummins offers practical, progressive solutions grounded in liberal values.

This isn't just another political book. It's a call to action for anyone who believes politics can be better, democracy is worth fighting for, and fresh thinking can cut through the bland offerings of our tired establishment.

**The lemons are already here. Are you ready for some lemonade?**
