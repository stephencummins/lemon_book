The Enlightenment Roots of Liberalism

*From Social Contracts to Individual Rights*

![Enlightenment - From Darkness to Reason](images/01_enlightenment.png)

Look at the Royal Coat of Arms, especially in our courtrooms. Written in French, since that was the language of our monarchs it says "Dieu et mon droit" - "God and my right". Basically, "I'm king Because God and my lineage says so". For almost a thousand years, since Richard the Lionheart, kings in England have used this as a battle cry. But really, does their right to rule really come from God? Where, in fact, does legitimate power come from? Is the law of the land actually legitimate just because the king or queen says so? If not, what is the basis for a law. Is a law good because it is the law or is it the law good because it is good? This chapter talks about the roots of Liberalism in this context.

## Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679)

To understand Thomas Hobbes, you have to imagine a world turned upside down. He lived through the English Civil War (1642-1651), a period of brutal conflict, political chaos, and the execution of a king (Charles I). This experience profoundly shaped his political philosophy, leading him to prioritise order and stability above all else. For Hobbes, the ultimate terror was not tyranny, but the anarchy of a "state of nature," where life is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." The central tension in his work is the stark choice he presents: absolute, undivided power, or a descent into a war of all against all. It's a grim choice, but one that he believed was unavoidable. So we can see that both men were reacting to negative events which, ultimately, led to a stronger democracy. The long-term effects of the Glorious Revolution on modern democratic systems are profound. It established a framework for constitutional monarchy that emphasised the rule of law and individual rights over absolute authority and the "Divine Right Of Kings"

Hobbes's most famous work, *Leviathan* (1651), is a powerful argument for the necessity of a strong, centralised government. He argued that to escape the horrors of the state of nature, individuals must enter into a **social contract**, surrendering some of their individual freedoms to a sovereign authority (a monarch or an assembly) in exchange for security and the rule of law. This sovereign, the "Leviathan," would have absolute power to enforce laws and prevent society from collapsing back into chaos. While this sounds profoundly illiberal, Hobbes's ideas contained several seeds that would later blossom in liberal thought:

- **Individualism:** Hobbes's political theory starts with the individual. He argued that society is composed of self-interested individuals, each seeking their own preservation and happiness. This focus on the individual as the fundamental unit of political analysis is a cornerstone of liberalism.

- **Social Contract Theory:** The idea that government derives its legitimacy from an agreement among individuals, rather than from divine right or tradition, was revolutionary. While Hobbes used this concept to justify absolute power, later thinkers like Locke would use it to argue for limited government and individual rights.

- **Materialism and Rationalism:** Hobbes's materialist philosophy and his emphasis on reason as a tool for understanding the world challenged traditional religious and aristocratic authority. This rational approach to politics would become central to Enlightenment thinking.

---

- **Equality in the State of Nature:** Hobbes argued that in the state of nature, all individuals are fundamentally equal in their capacity to harm one another. This notion of natural equality, though used by Hobbes to justify the need for absolute power, would later be employed by liberals to argue for equal rights and democratic governance.

The tension in Hobbes's work is that while he provided intellectual tools that would later be used to justify liberal democracy, his immediate concern was to prevent the chaos he had witnessed during the Civil War. His solution – absolute sovereignty – was antithetical to later liberal ideals, but his method – starting with individuals and their rational self-interest – became foundational to liberal thought.

## John Locke (1632-1704)

John Locke (1632-1704) emerged from a different crucible than Hobbes, though one equally fraught with political tension. He lived through the tumultuous period of the English Civil War, the Interregnum (when England was a republic), and the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Unlike Hobbes, who sought to justify absolute power to prevent chaos, Locke aimed to justify resistance to tyrannical rule and establish a framework for legitimate, limited government. His ideas were a direct challenge to the prevailing doctrines of divine right monarchy and the consolidation of power in the hands of a few.

Locke’s seminal work, *Two Treatises of Government* (published anonymously in 1689, though written earlier), served as a powerful intellectual defence of the Glorious Revolution, which saw the deposition of James II and the establishment of a constitutional monarchy. This was a pivotal moment where the power of the monarch was explicitly limited by Parliament, a direct embodiment of Locke’s emerging liberal ideals. The tension here was palpable: the entrenched power of the monarchy, claiming authority from God, clashed violently with the burgeoning belief in individual rights and popular sovereignty.

Key contributions from Locke, often seen as the father of classical liberalism, include:

- **Natural Rights:** Locke argued that individuals possess inherent natural rights to life, liberty, and property, which are not granted by any government but are intrinsic to human existence. These rights are inalienable and precede the formation of any society or state.

- **Social Contract Theory:** He posited that governments derive their legitimacy from the consent of the governed through a social contract. This contract is an agreement between individuals to form a society and establish a government to protect their natural rights. If the government fails to uphold its end of the contract and infringes upon these rights, the people have the right to resist and even overthrow it.

- **Limited Government:** Locke was a strong proponent of limited government, arguing that the power of the state should be constrained to protect individual liberties. He advocated for a separation of powers within government to prevent tyranny and ensure checks and balances.

- **Religious Toleration:** Locke championed religious toleration, arguing that the state should not interfere with individuals' religious beliefs, as long as those beliefs do not disrupt civil order. He believed that faith was a matter of individual conscience.

- **Empiricism:** As a founder of British empiricism, Locke argued that all knowledge is derived from sensory experience, rather than innate ideas. This epistemological stance influenced his political philosophy by emphasising the importance of experience and reason in understanding the world and forming political systems.

Locke's work, particularly *Two Treatises of Government* (1689), laid much of the groundwork for modern liberal thought and significantly influenced the American Declaration of Independence and the development of constitutional democracies worldwide.

## David Hume (1711-1776)

David Hume (1711-1776), a towering figure of the Scottish Enlightenment, lived in a period of intellectual ferment and burgeoning commercial society. Unlike Locke, who directly engaged with the political upheavals of his time, Hume was more of an academic philosopher, historian, and essayist. However, his profound empiricism and scepticism towards abstract reasoning had significant, albeit indirect, implications for liberal thought. He was observing a society where traditional hierarchies were slowly giving way to new forms of economic and social organisation, driven by trade and individual enterprise. The tension in Hume's work often lies in his pragmatic acceptance of existing power structures and customs, while simultaneously providing intellectual tools that would undermine their absolute claims.

Hume’s approach was to ground political and moral principles not in abstract natural rights or divine commands, but in human experience, utility, and custom. He was deeply suspicious of grand theories and revolutionary zeal, preferring gradual evolution and stability. Yet, his emphasis on the practical benefits of limited government, the rule of law, and a thriving commercial society provided a powerful, non-ideological argument for liberal institutions. He implicitly challenged the notion that power derived from anything other than its utility in maintaining a stable and prosperous society. If a government ceased to be useful, its legitimacy would naturally erode, not through a violent social contract breach, but through a gradual shift in public sentiment and practical inconvenience. He was, in essence, the ultimate pragmatist, arguing that if it ain't broke, don't fix it, but if it is, then a sensible, gradual adjustment is in order, rather than a full-scale philosophical revolution. He was the kind of philosopher who'd probably tut at a poorly constructed argument over a dram of whisky, rather than lead a charge to the barricades.

Key aspects of his influence include:

- **Emphasis on Experience and Utility:** Hume's empiricism, which asserted that knowledge is derived from sensory experience, extended to his moral and political philosophy. He argued that moral and political principles are not based on abstract reason or divine command, but on human sentiments, utility, and experience. This focus on practical consequences and what works for society aligns with a pragmatic liberal approach.

- **Limited Government and Rule of Law:** Hume stressed the benefits of limited government and the importance of the rule of law for social order and stability. He believed that government authority, while necessary, should be constrained to protect individual liberties and property rights. His historical writings often highlighted the dangers of arbitrary power and the advantages of constitutional governance.

- **Self-Interest and Social Order:** Hume explored how self-interest, when properly channeled, could contribute to social order and the common good. He argued that conventions and institutions, such as property rights and justice, arise from the recognition of mutual advantage, rather than from a formal social contract. This perspective influenced later liberal economic thought, particularly Adam Smith.

- **Scepticism towards Abstract Principles:** Hume's scepticism extended to abstract political theories, including some aspects of social contract theory. He preferred to ground political arrangements in historical experience, custom, and the practical needs of society. This pragmatic approach, focusing on what actually works to maintain a stable and prosperous society, is a hallmark of classical liberalism.

---

- **Advocacy for Commercial Society:** Hume was a strong advocate for commercial society, believing that trade and economic exchange fostered civility, prosperity, and a more refined moral sense. He saw commerce as a force that could break down traditional hierarchies and promote individual liberty, contributing to the liberal ideal of an open and dynamic society.

While some scholars have characterised Hume as a conservative philosopher due to his emphasis on tradition and order, his overall stress on limited government, individual liberty, and the benefits of a commercial society firmly places him within the broader liberal tradition.

## John Stuart Mill (1806-1873)

John Stuart Mill stands as a towering figure in the history of liberal thought, often seen as a bridge between classical liberalism and the emerging social liberalism of the late 19th century. His work profoundly influenced the understanding of liberty, individuality, and the role of the state. Mill’s contributions are particularly significant for their nuanced approach to individual freedom and his advocacy for social reforms [1, 2].

Key aspects of Mill’s influence on liberalism include:

- **The Harm Principle:** Articulated most famously in *On Liberty* (1859), the Harm Principle states that the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. This principle became a cornerstone of liberal thought, defining the boundaries of individual freedom and state intervention. [1, 3, 4].

---

- **Freedom of Thought and Discussion:** Mill was a passionate defender of freedom of speech and expression, arguing that the suppression of opinion is always wrong. He believed that open debate, even of false ideas, is essential for the discovery of truth and the intellectual development of society. He contended that even if an opinion is wrong, its discussion forces others to re-examine and justify their own beliefs, preventing them from becoming dead dogma.

- **Individuality and Self-Development:** Mill placed great emphasis on the importance of individuality and the cultivation of diverse ways of living. He argued that a society that encourages individuals to develop their unique talents and pursue their own conceptions of the good life is more vibrant and progressive. This focus on self-realisation and personal growth is a key aspect of his liberalism.

- **Utilitarianism and its Refinement:** While a proponent of utilitarianism (the greatest good for the greatest number), Mill refined the doctrine by distinguishing between higher and lower pleasures, arguing that intellectual and moral pleasures are superior to purely sensual ones. This refinement sought to address criticisms that utilitarianism could lead to a 'pig's philosophy' focused solely on base gratification.

- **Advocacy for Women's Rights and Equality:** Mill was a pioneering advocate for women's rights and equality, co-authoring *The Subjection of Women* (1869) with his wife Harriet Taylor Mill. He argued forcefully against the legal and social subordination of women, seeing it as a fundamental barrier to individual liberty and societal progress.

## Modern Liberalism (20th Century)

As the 20th century dawned, the confident stride of classical liberalism began to falter. The unfettered markets championed by Adam Smith, while generating immense wealth, also produced stark inequalities, urban squalor, and economic instability. The two World Wars shattered illusions of inevitable progress, and the Great Depression exposed the fragility of purely self-regulating economies. These seismic shifts demanded a new kind of liberalism, one that recognised the need for collective action and state intervention to safeguard individual freedom and promote social justice. It was a time when liberals realised that sometimes, even the most individualistic of knights needed a bit of communal armour to face the dragons of poverty, disease, and ignorance. And perhaps a very large, wooden rabbit.

---

The intellectual response to these challenges coalesced into what became known as **modern liberalism** or **social liberalism**. A pivotal figure in this evolution was **John Maynard Keynes** (1883-1946), whose economic theories fundamentally reshaped the liberal understanding of the state’s role. Writing in the wake of the Great Depression, Keynes argued that free markets, left entirely to their own devices, could lead to prolonged periods of unemployment and underproduction. He advocated for **government intervention** through fiscal and monetary policies – such as public spending and interest rate adjustments – to manage the economy, stimulate demand, and ensure full employment. This was not a rejection of capitalism, but a pragmatic attempt to save it from its own excesses, ensuring its stability and preventing the social unrest that could lead to more radical alternatives. Keynesian economics became the foundation for the post-war consensus in many Western democracies, demonstrating that a liberal state could actively manage the economy for the benefit of all, without resorting to authoritarian control. It was, in essence, the liberal equivalent of giving the economy a good, sensible talking-to, rather than letting it run wild in the streets.

The horrors of World War II further galvanised the commitment to social welfare. In Britain, this led to the groundbreaking **Beveridge Report** (1942), which laid the blueprint for the modern welfare state. William Beveridge identified five “Giant Evils” afflicting society: Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor, and Idleness. The report proposed a comprehensive system of social insurance, universal healthcare (the NHS), free education, and decent housing, all designed to provide a safety net “from the cradle to the grave.” This was a profoundly liberal vision, arguing that true individual freedom could only be realised when individuals were liberated from the crushing burdens of poverty and insecurity. The state, far from being a minimal night-watchman, was now seen as an enabler, actively creating the conditions for individuals to flourish. It’s a monumental undertaking, a bit like building a very large, very comfortable, and universally accessible sofa for the entire nation to recline upon.

The **post-war consensus** saw both Labour and Conservative governments largely adhere to these Keynesian and Beveridgean principles, creating a mixed economy and an expansive welfare state. However, this consensus began to fray in the 1970s, challenged by economic stagnation and a growing critique from the **New Right**. Figures like Margaret Thatcher in the UK and Ronald Reagan in the US argued that the welfare state had become bloated and inefficient, stifling individual initiative and economic growth. They advocated for a return to more classical liberal principles: deregulation, privatisation, and reduced state spending. This period saw a significant ideological battle over the role and scope of the liberal state, demonstrating that liberalism itself is not a static doctrine but a dynamic conversation.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, modern liberalism has continued to evolve, grappling with new and complex challenges. **Globalisation** has brought unprecedented interconnectedness but also raised questions about national sovereignty and economic justice. **Technological change**, particularly the rise of the internet and artificial intelligence, presents both immense opportunities and new threats to privacy and democratic processes. **New social movements** have pushed liberalism to expand its understanding of rights and equality, encompassing environmental concerns (**environmental liberalism**), human rights, and the complexities of identity politics. Liberals have had to confront issues like climate change, global poverty, and the rise of illiberal democracies, all while defending core liberal values against the resurgence of populism and authoritarianism.

We still have a king, but Charles III reigns but does not rule. Parliament is Sovereign now. It was a long journey to that position, but there is still space to improve. Descendants of William the Conqueror's Norman army still own approximately 70% of Britain's land, held by less than 1% of the population. Around 160,000 families—comprising just 0.3% of the population—control about 66% of the country.

After the 1066 conquest, William seized all land and distributed it to roughly 170 loyal nobles. This concentrated ownership has been maintained for nearly a millennium through inheritance tax exemptions for agricultural land and large estates. Charles III and the royal family are the largest land owners in the world. Directly owning around 260,000 acres in the UK, with a further 615,000 acres held via the Crown Estate.  The family's private holdings include Balmoral (50,000 acres), Sandringham (20,000 acres), and Delnadamph Estate (7,000 acres)—totaling about 72,000 acres of personal property. Larger than Rhode Island but smaller than Delaware.mThe Crown Estate is valued at approximately £15.6 billion and includes 115,000 hectares of agricultural land and forests, central London properties, and about 55% of UK foreshore.

Vast wealth inequality is still the biggest problem in our society after 10 centuries. What will the 21st Century bring?
