---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Option A: Minimal Editing Approach (RECOMMENDED)
This is the easiest and preserves all content:

1. **Condense Introduction** - Cut 00_introduction.md from 514 to 275 words (make it punchier)
2. **Expand Front Matter** - Add dedication, flesh out About Author and Acknowledgements
3. **Expand Chapter 1 slightly** - Add ~488 words of contemporary examples/relevance
4. **Minimal touch-ups** - Very minor edits to a few chapters (under 100 words each)

**Estimated work:** 4-6 hours of focused editing

---

### Option B: Redistribution Approach
Alternative if you don't want to add content:

1. **Reduce Chapter 1 page allocation** - From 13 pages to 11 pages (saves 550 words needed)
2. **Condense Introduction** - As above
3. **Expand Front Matter** - As above
4. **Minor redistributions** - Adjust a few other chapters by 1 page

**Estimated work:** 3-4 hours, but changes page numbering

---

### Option C: Perfect Balance Approach (MAXIMUM EFFORT)
For absolute precision:

1. **Every chapter hits exact target** - Trim or expand each chapter to exactly match page allocation
2. **Perfect front matter** - Complete dedication, About, and Acknowledgements
3. **Rebalanced introduction** - Exactly 275 words

**Estimated work:** 8-12 hours
**Benefit:** Every page perfectly filled
**Drawback:** May harm flow and readability for minimal gain
