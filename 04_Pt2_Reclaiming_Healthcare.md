# Chapter 4 - Part II

*From Bevan's Vision to Market Chaos*

![The NHS - A Service For All](/images/04II_physical_health.png)

The National Health Service represents one of the greatest achievements of British liberalism – a radical commitment to the principle that healthcare is a fundamental right, not a commodity to be purchased by those who can afford it. When Aneurin Bevan launched the NHS in 1948, he articulated a profoundly liberal vision: healthcare free at the point of use, available to all, funded through progressive taxation. This was liberalism at its best – recognising that genuine freedom requires not just the absence of interference, but access to the resources necessary for human flourishing.

Yet today, that vision lies in ruins. The NHS is in crisis, not because the founding principles were wrong, but because successive governments have systematically undermined them. Waiting lists have reached record levels, with over 7 million people waiting for treatment. A&E departments are overwhelmed, with patients waiting hours on trolleys in corridors. GP appointments are nearly impossible to secure. Staff are burnt out, demoralised, and leaving in droves. The service that was meant to care for us all now struggles to care for anyone adequately.

This crisis was not inevitable. It is the direct result of political choices – the introduction of internal markets, the creation of NHS Trusts, the creeping privatisation of services, and the systematic underfunding that has left the NHS unable to meet the needs of a growing and ageing population. The transformation of healthcare from a public service into a quasi-market has failed patients, staff, and the fundamental liberal principles upon which the NHS was founded.

## The Liberal Foundation: Healthcare as a Right

The NHS was born from social liberal thinking that emerged in the early 20th century. Liberals like Lloyd George and William Beveridge understood that genuine freedom required more than just political rights – it required freedom from the "giant evils" of want, disease, ignorance, squalor, and idleness. Healthcare was not a privilege to be earned or purchased, but a prerequisite for human dignity and meaningful choice.

This vision was radical precisely because it rejected the market fundamentalism that saw healthcare as just another commodity. The liberal architects of the welfare state understood that healthcare is different – that when you're sick, you cannot shop around, that information asymmetry makes genuine market choice impossible, and that leaving healthcare to the market inevitably means that the poor die young while the rich live long.

The NHS embodied several core liberal principles:

- **Universality**: Healthcare available to all, regardless of ability to pay
- **Equality**: The same standard of care for everyone, from the street cleaner to the Prime Minister
- **Comprehensive**: Covering all health needs, from prevention to end-of-life care
- **Free at Point of Use**: Removing financial barriers that prevent people from seeking care
- **Funded by Taxation**: Those with broader shoulders contributing more

For decades, this model worked. The NHS delivered better health outcomes at lower cost than market-based systems. It was more efficient than American healthcare, more equitable than insurance-based European systems, and more popular than any other British institution.

## The Trust System: Fragmenting a Service

The rot began in the 1990s with the introduction of the "internal market" and the creation of NHS Trusts. The Conservative government of the time, influenced by market fundamentalism, decided that the NHS would work better if it operated like a business. Hospitals became autonomous Trusts, competing with each other for contracts from commissioning bodies. The service was fragmented into purchasers and providers, introducing transaction costs and bureaucracy that had never existed before.

This was presented as "modernisation" and "reform" – classic examples of the linguistic corruption discussed in Chapter 16. But the reality was the destruction of a coordinated national service and its replacement with a fragmented pseudo-market that has failed on every measure.

### The Problems with NHS Trusts:

**1. Financial Gaming Over Patient Care**
Trusts operate with their own budgets and are judged primarily on financial performance. This creates perverse incentives where Trusts make decisions based on what benefits their balance sheet rather than what serves patients. Profitable treatments are prioritised over essential but expensive ones. Trusts compete for resources rather than cooperating for patient benefit.

**2. Administrative Bloat**
The internal market requires vast bureaucracy to manage contracts, invoices, and competitive tendering. Each Trust maintains its own management structure, legal team, procurement department, and marketing operation. Money that should pay for nurses and doctors instead pays for administrators and management consultants. The NHS now employs more managers than hospital beds – an absurd inversion of priorities.

**3. Postcode Lottery**
When each Trust operates independently, standards fragment across the country. What treatment you can access, how long you wait, and what quality of care you receive depends on which Trust area you live in. The principle of equality – that all citizens deserve the same standard of care – has been abandoned.

**4. Short-Termism**
Trusts, judged on annual financial performance, focus on short-term savings rather than long-term investment. Preventive care, staff training, and maintenance are cut because they don't show immediate financial returns. The result is a system that lurches from crisis to crisis, always firefighting rather than planning strategically.

**5. Collaboration Collapse**
Healthcare requires cooperation between different specialties, organisations, and sectors. But when organisations are set up to compete, collaboration suffers. Information isn't shared, resources aren't pooled, and patients fall through the cracks between competing Trusts.

## The Privatisation Agenda: Profits Before Patients

The Trust system paved the way for wholesale privatisation. Once the NHS was fragmented into competing units, it became easier to allow private companies to bid for contracts. This was never about improving efficiency – it was about creating profit opportunities for private healthcare companies.

### The Reality of NHS Privatisation:

**1. Cherry-Picking Profitable Services**
Private companies take profitable, straightforward procedures while leaving expensive, complex care to the NHS. Hip replacements and cataract operations go private; emergency care, mental health, and chronic disease management stay public. This cream-skimming leaves the NHS with the most challenging cases and least resources.

**2. Lower Standards, Higher Costs**
Contrary to the promises, privatisation has not delivered better value. Private providers often charge more than it costs the NHS to provide the same service. They cut corners on staffing, use inexperienced staff, and refer complex cases back to the NHS. When things go wrong – as with the Southern Cross care home collapse – taxpayers pick up the bill.

**3. The PFI Disaster**
The Private Finance Initiative, used to build new hospitals, represents one of the greatest financial scandals in NHS history. Hospitals built with private money under PFI deals are saddled with debt repayments that far exceed what public borrowing would have cost. Some Trusts pay more in PFI repayments than they spend on doctors and nurses. This is not efficiency – it is a government-sanctioned transfer of wealth from the public sector to private finance.

**4. Staff Exploitation**
Private companies operating NHS services often employ staff on worse terms and conditions than NHS employment. Lower pay, fewer benefits, less job security – all to generate profits for shareholders. When these companies cherry-pick NHS services, they undermine the terms and conditions of all NHS workers.

**5. Profit Extraction**
Every pound that goes to private healthcare shareholders is a pound not spent on patient care. The NHS is not short of money because of demographics or medical advances – it's short of money because profits are being extracted rather than reinvested in the service.

## The Decline in Service Quality

The combined effect of the Trust system and privatisation has been a catastrophic decline in service quality:

**Waiting Times**
Waiting lists have exploded to record levels. In 2010, 2.5 million people were waiting for treatment. Today it's over 7 million. The 18-week target for starting treatment is routinely missed. Patients wait months in pain for routine operations. Some die waiting.

**A&E Crisis**
Emergency departments are overwhelmed. The four-hour target – that patients should be seen, treated, and admitted or discharged within four hours – is missed more often than it's met. Patients wait on trolleys in corridors. Ambulances queue outside hospitals, unable to discharge patients because there are no beds.

**GP Access**
Getting a GP appointment has become nearly impossible. Practices are overwhelmed, appointments are rationed, and patients are pushed to phone triage systems that often fail to identify serious conditions. The traditional model of family medicine – where your GP knows you and can provide continuous care – has collapsed.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Staff Crisis**
The NHS is haemorrhaging staff. Nurses, doctors, and other healthcare professionals are leaving in record numbers, burnt out by impossible workloads, demoralised by poor conditions, and exhausted from years of real-terms pay cuts. The NHS now relies on expensive agency staff to fill gaps, further straining budgets.

**Mental Health**
Despite political promises of "parity of esteem," mental health services remain the poor relation. Child and adolescent mental health services turn away children in crisis because they don't meet thresholds. Adult services are overwhelmed. People in mental health crisis wait hours in A&E because there are no mental health beds available.

## The Marketisation Failure

The fundamental problem is that healthcare cannot function as a market because it violates every condition necessary for markets to work efficiently:

**Information Asymmetry**
Patients cannot make informed choices about treatment because they lack medical knowledge. The doctor-patient relationship requires trust, not the adversarial dynamics of market transactions.

**Emergency Care**
When you're having a heart attack, you cannot shop around for the best price. Healthcare is not a voluntary transaction – often it's literally life or death.

**Monopoly Power**
Healthcare providers have local monopolies. If your nearest hospital is 30 miles away, you don't have meaningful choice, regardless of how many Trusts theoretically compete.

**Externalities**
Healthcare decisions affect others – infectious diseases spread, mental health problems impact families and communities. Markets cannot account for these social effects.

**Moral Hazard**
Insurance-based systems create incentives for overtreatment (providers profit from doing more) and undertreatment (insurers profit from denying claims). Neither serves patients.

## The Liberal Solution: Healthcare as a Service

The liberal answer to the NHS crisis is not more marketisation but a return to the founding principle: healthcare as a public service, not a business. This means:

<div align="right"><sub>45</sub></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

---

**1. Abolish NHS Trusts**
Replace the fragmented Trust system with regional health authorities that coordinate care across areas. These would be accountable to local communities and national standards, not financial targets. The internal market would be abolished, ending the wasteful bureaucracy of competitive tendering and contract management.

**2. End Privatisation**
Bring privatised services back into public ownership and operation. This doesn't mean never working with private providers – the NHS has always purchased things from private companies. But it means ending the outsourcing of clinical services and the extraction of profits from patient care.

**3. Integrate Services**
Create genuinely integrated care that connects GP surgeries, hospitals, mental health services, social care, and public health. This requires ending the competitive dynamics that prevent cooperation and instead building systems that incentivise collaboration.

**4. National Standards, Local Delivery**
Establish clear national standards for care that apply everywhere, ending the postcode lottery. But deliver services locally, with real community involvement in priorities and accountability. This means elected health boards with genuine powers, not the sham consultations that characterise current "patient engagement."

**5. Adequate Funding**
Fund the NHS properly through progressive taxation. Britain spends less on healthcare as a percentage of GDP than most comparable countries. The NHS isn't failing because of inefficiency – it's failing because it's been systematically underfunded while demand has grown.

**6. Staff Investment**
Pay healthcare workers properly, provide adequate training and development opportunities, ensure safe staffing levels, and give staff a real voice in how services are organised. The NHS's greatest asset is its workforce – we must invest in them, not exploit them.

**7. Prevention Focus**
Shift resources toward prevention and public health. Tackling the social determinants of health – poverty, poor housing, pollution, unhealthy food – would prevent illness and reduce demand on acute services.

<div align="right"><sub>46</sub></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

---

**8. Democratic Accountability**
Make the NHS truly accountable to the public it serves, not to private shareholders or unelected Trust boards. This means transparency about performance, meaningful public involvement in decision-making, and democratic oversight of priorities and spending.

## Learning from International Examples

Other countries show that different approaches are possible:

**The Scandinavian Model**
Nordic countries achieve better health outcomes than Britain with publicly funded, publicly delivered healthcare that rejects marketisation. They invest more, value their staff, and focus on prevention.

**The Spanish Regional System**
Spain's regional health services demonstrate how to maintain national standards while allowing local flexibility, without fragmenting into competing Trusts.

**The Best of Europe**
Many European countries achieve universal coverage without fragmenting services into internal markets. They show that coordination and cooperation work better than competition.

## The Cost of Inaction

Every day the current system continues, people suffer:

- Patients die waiting for treatment
- Treatable conditions become chronic because of delayed diagnosis
- Staff burn out and leave, creating vicious cycles of understaffing
- Health inequalities widen as those who can afford it go private
- Trust in the NHS erodes, making future reform harder

The human cost is incalculable. Behind every statistic is a person in pain, a family worried sick, a healthcare worker stretched beyond breaking point.

## The Political Challenge

Reforming the NHS faces powerful opposition. Private healthcare companies profit from the current system. Management consultants make fortunes advising on "efficiency." Politicians fear being accused of creating another reorganisation. Trade unions worry about job losses. Vested interests will fight to preserve the status quo.

But the greater political risk is doing nothing. The NHS is in terminal decline under the current model. Without fundamental reform, it will continue to deteriorate until it becomes so dysfunctional that privatisation becomes inevitable – not through ideological choice but through practical failure.

<div align="right"><sub>47</sub></div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The liberal case for NHS reform is both principled and pragmatic. Principled because healthcare is a right, not a commodity. Pragmatic because the current system is failing on every measure and only radical reform can save it.

## Reclaiming the Liberal Vision

The NHS was built on liberal principles – that genuine freedom requires security, that human dignity demands healthcare for all, that society has collective responsibilities that markets cannot fulfil. These principles remain as valid today as in 1948.

What has failed is not the NHS model, but the abandonment of that model in favour of market fundamentalism. The solution is not more privatisation, more competition, or more "efficiency savings." The solution is returning to the founding vision: healthcare as a public service, delivered by public servants, accountable to the public.

This requires courage – courage to challenge powerful interests, courage to reverse failed policies, courage to invest properly in public services. But it also offers hope – hope that we can rebuild an NHS that serves all of us, hope that we can demonstrate that public services can work, hope that we can reclaim the liberal legacy of the welfare state.

The NHS is not just a health service – it is a statement about what kind of society we want to be. A society where your ability to live a healthy life depends on your ability to pay is not a liberal society. A society where healthcare is a right, not a privilege, where the sick are cared for regardless of circumstances – that is a society worthy of the liberal tradition.

## Conclusion: A Service, Not a Business

The fundamental error of the past three decades has been treating healthcare as a business rather than a service. Businesses exist to generate profits. Services exist to meet needs. Healthcare is a service – one of the most important services society provides.

When we run the NHS as a business, we get business outcomes: focus on profitable services, cost-cutting that undermines quality, competition that prevents collaboration, short-termism that neglects long-term investment. When we run it as a service, we get service outcomes: universal coverage, equity of access, coordination of care, investment in prevention.

The choice is stark: continue down the path of marketisation and privatisation until the NHS is unrecognisable, or reclaim the founding vision and rebuild the NHS as a public service. For liberals, committed to human dignity and social justice, that choice is clear.

The NHS is in crisis not because public services cannot work, but because we have stopped treating it as a public service. The solution is not more markets, but better public service. Not more competition, but more cooperation. Not more profit extraction, but more public investment.

Bevan's vision remains sound. What we need is the political will to defend it, the intellectual honesty to acknowledge where we've gone wrong, and the courage to reverse course. The NHS can be saved – but only if we reclaim healthcare as a public service, not a business opportunity.

The question is not whether we can afford to properly fund and reform the NHS. The question is whether we can afford not to. In a civilised, liberal society, healthcare is not a luxury but a necessity, not a commodity but a right. It's time we started treating it that way.
